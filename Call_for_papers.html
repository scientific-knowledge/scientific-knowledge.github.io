<h1 id="CfP">Call for Papers</h1>
<p>  
We invite the submission of long, short or demo papers for topics related to the extraction of structured knowledge from scientific publications, included but not limited to:
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Information extraction from scientific publications</li>

<ul>
<li>identification of concepts in scientific articles (in various domains)</li>
<li>extraction of relations from scientific articles (in various domains) — including n-ary relations with n>2, “negative relations”</li>
<li>large scale information extraction, clustering and detection of trends in scientific fields</li>
<li>targeted information extraction for completing knowledge graphs</li>
<li>updating knowledge graphs (adding new information, removing erroneous facts, or possibly having explicit links for incorrect statements)</li>
</ul>

<li>finding patterns and mining new information in knowledge graphs</li>

<ul>
<li>automatic generation and ranking of scientific hypotheses</li>
  <li>aggregation and extraction of human-understandable scientific rules and generalities</li>
  <li>extraction of script-knowledge and scientific procedures</li>
  <li>detection of (inferred or explicitly stated) causality</li>
  <li>automated reasoning over repositories of extracted information</li>
</ul>

<li>Using extracted structured knowledge</li>
  <ul>
    <li>visualization of knowledge in particular domains</li>
    <li>tools for interacting with users</li>
    <li>querying knowledge graphs/knowledge repositories</li>
    <li>evaluation of extracted knowledge</li>
  </ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="guide">Guidelines</h2>

  <p>Reviewing for the workshop will be <b>double blind, except for the demo papers, which are single blind</b> We follow the <a href="https://naacl2019.org/calls/papers/">NAACL guidelines</a> regarding paper content, formatting and submission (which we partly quote below):</p>

<br />
<b>Long Papers</b>

  
<p>Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included.</p>

<p>Long paper submissions may consist of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited references; final camera-ready versions of accepted long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.</p>

<p>Long papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. The decisions as to which papers will be presented orally and which as poster presentations will be based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. There will be no distinction in the proceedings between long papers presented orally and those presented as posters.</p>

  <br />
<b>Short Papers</b>

<p>Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Some kinds of short papers are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A small, focused contribution</li>
    <li>Work in progress</li>
    <li>A negative result</li>
    <li>An opinion piece</li>
    <li>An interesting application nugget</li>
</ul>    

<p>Short paper submissions may consist of up to five (5) pages of content, plus unlimited references. </p>

<p>Short papers will be presented in one or more oral or poster sessions. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between short papers presented orally and as posters.</p>
  
  <br />
  <b>Demo Papers</b>  
  
  <p>The demo paper should include the motivation and technical details of the system, including visual aids (e.g., screenshots, snapshots, or diagrams). See examples of recent accepted demo papers in NAACL 2018, ACL 2018, ACL 2017, EMNLP 2017, NAACL 2016, ACL 2015, NAACL 2015.</p>
  
  <p>If possible, we recommend that you also include a link to a website that hosts or demonstrates your system in the paper draft. Because anonymity of the system is difficult or impossible, demo submissions should have authors included, and do not have to abide by anonymity constraints.</p>
  
  <p>Demo paper length is similar to the short papers (max 5 pages)</p>
  
  <br />
  
<h2 id="style">Style and format guidelines</h2>

<p>Submissions should follow the NAACL-HLT 2019 style guidelines. Long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings without exceeding eight (8) pages of content. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL proceedings, and must not exceed four (5) pages. References do not count against these limits. We strongly recommend the use of the official NAACL-HLT 2019 style templates:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-latex.zip">LaTeX</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://naacl2019.org/downloads/naaclhlt2019-word.zip">Microsoft Word</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-naacl-hlt-2019-proceedings/xyyfwfkswhth">Overleaf</a></li>
</ul>

  <p>All submissions must be in PDF format.</p>

<p>Submissions that do not adhere to the above author guidelines or ACL policies will be rejected without review.</p>

  <br />
  <h2 id="lang">Language help</h2>
  
  Message from NAACL organizers:
  <br />
  <p> As part of the efforts to improve diversity and inclusion in at the NAACL 2019 conference, we are pleased to offer a service that may help authors improve their workshop submissions. Grammarly is a program that checks your English writing and suggests corrections. We are providing free premium access to authors for one month. You may benefit especially if you are not a native English speaker or if you have other difficulties with writing or proofreading.  Presenting your research in clear standard English can increase your paper's chances of getting good reviews and, if accepted, a wide audience. </p>
  <p> To use this service, please fill out this <a href="https://bit.ly/2Ssp4Pq">Grammarly code request form</a> </p>
  <p> You should receive an email with the premium access code and further instructions within one day. </p> 
  <p> We hope that this initiative will especially benefit non-native English speakers in the NLP community. We thank Grammarly for generously donating this service (at our request) and supporting diversity and inclusion in NLP!" </p>
  
<br />  
<h2 id="sub">Paper Submission</h2>

<p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management for both long and short papers.</p>
