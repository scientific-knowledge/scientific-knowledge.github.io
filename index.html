<h2>Workshop on extracting structured knowledge from scientific publications (ESSP)</h2>
  
  <h3>June 6th, 2019, Minneapolis, USA</h3>  
 
  <br>
  <h3>Collocated with <a href="https://naacl2019.org/">NAACL 2019</a> </h3>  

  <p>
Scientific knowledge is one of the greatest assets of humankind. 
This knowledge is recorded and disseminated in scientific publications, and the body of scientific literature is growing at an enormous rate.
Automatic methods of processing and cataloguing that information are necessary for assisting scientists to navigate this vast amount of information, and for facilitating automated reasoning, discovery and decision making on that data.
</p>
  <p>
Structured information can be extracted at different levels of granularity.
Previous and ongoing work has focused on bibliographic information (segmentation and linking of referenced literature, Wick et al., 2013), keyword extraction and categorization (e.g., what are tasks, materials and processes central to a publication, (Augenstein et al., 2017)), and cataloguing research findings. Scientific discoveries can often be represented as pairwise relationships, e.g., protein-protein (Mallory et al., 2016), drug-drug (Segura-Bedmar et al., 2013), and chemical-disease (Li et al., 2016) interactions, or as more complicated networks such as action graphs describing scientific procedures (e.g., synthesis recipes in material sciences, (Mysore et al., 2017)). Information extracted with such methods can be enriched with time-stamps, and other meta-information, such as indicators of uncertainty or limitations of the discovered facts (Zhou et al., 2015).
  </p>
Structured representations, such as knowledge graphs, summarize information from a variety of sources in a convenient and machine readable format. Graph representations, that link the information of a large body of publications, can reveal patterns and lead to the discovery of new information that would not be apparent from the analysis of just one publication (Luan et al., 2018). This kind of aggregation can lead to new scientific insights (Kim et al., 2017), and it can also help to detect trends (Prabhakaran et al., 2016), or find experts for a particular scientific area (Neshati et al., 2014).
</p>
  <p>
While various workshops have focused separately on several aspects -- extraction of information from scientific articles, building and using knowledge graphs, the analysis of bibliographical information, graph algorithms for text analysis -- the proposed workshop focuses on processing scientific articles and creating structured repositories such as knowledge graphs for finding new information and making scientific discoveries.
The aim of this workshop is to identify the necessary representations for facilitating automated reasoning over scientific information, and to bring together experts in natural language processing and information extraction with scientists from other domains (e.g. material sciences, biomedical research) who want to leverage the vast amount of information stored in scientific publications.

  <li> <b>Dina Demner-Fushman</b> <br />National Library of Medicine<br />  <b>Extracting structured knowledge from biomedical publications</b> <br /> <p>
      The National Library of Medicine (NLM) plays a pivotal role in translating biomedical research into practice. One of the foundational tasks in supporting NLM goals is biomedical language processing. The talk will introduce NLM’s resources for biomedical and clinical NLP -- natural language processing methods to support healthcare by operationalizing clinical information contained in the biomedical literature and clinical narrative.
The talk will then focus on the approaches to extraction of structured knowledge from biomedical publications, highlighting automation and support of manual indexing of biomedical literature with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), as well as extraction of information from tables and the full text of articles. </p>
<br /> <p> Dina Demner-Fushman, Investigator, leads research in information retrieval and natural language processing at the National Library of Medicine. Dina earned a doctor of medicine degree from Kazan State Medical Institute, a clinical research Doctorate degree (PhD) in Medical Sciences from Moscow Medical and Stomatological Institute, and MS and PhD degrees in Computer Science from the University of Maryland. She is the author of more than 190 articles and book chapters in the fields of information retrieval, natural language processing, and biomedical and clinical informatics. She is a Fellow of the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI), an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, and one of the founding members of the Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest Group on biomedical natural language processing (SIGBioMed).

    The role of knowledge representation in automatic knowledge base construction </b> <br /> 
    <p> Automatic construction of knowledge-bases is an exciting synthesis of research in machine learning, knowledge representation, natural language processing, and recently, crowdsourcing.  Due to the ever increasing over-speciation of researchers in AI, most work in the area strongly emphasizes one of these four areas, and as a result, de-emphasizes the others.  Bringing these diverse elements together requires learning a few things from each other, which, when treated as equals, can force us to re-evaluate tacit assumptions that one field makes and another throws away.  My own journey from formal knowledge representation and ontologies thru building Watson and more recent AI systems at Google Research, led me to re-evaluate the long-held tacit assumptions of the knowledge representation field and come to a new understanding of its role in AI</p>
